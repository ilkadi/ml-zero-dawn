# Machine Learning Zero Dawn

This project is a collection of various machine learning problems solved from scratch, aiming to map a wide range of problems using ML/AI. 

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories, each representing a step in the roadmap of ML/AI problems:

### Active
1. `0_binary_classification`: Binary classification problems, such as predicting whether an email is spam or not.

### To Be Done
2. `1_multiclass_classification`: Multiclass classification problems, such as digit recognition.
3. `2_regression`: Regression problems, such as predicting house prices.
4. `3_clustering`: Unsupervised learning problems, such as customer segmentation using k-means clustering.
5. `4_dimensionality_reduction`: Dimensionality reduction problems using PCA.
6. `5_image_classification`: Image classification problems, starting with simple datasets like CIFAR-10.
7. `6_object_detection`: Object detection in images using techniques like R-CNN, YOLO, or SSD.
8. `7_nlp`: Natural Language Processing problems, starting with sentiment analysis.
9. `8_reinforcement_learning`: Game solving or control problems using reinforcement learning.
10. `9_generative_models`: Generating new data with generative models.
11. `10_audio_recognition`: Audio recognition problems, such as speech recognition or music genre classification.
12. `11_time_series_analysis`: Time series analysis problems, such as forecasting stock prices.
